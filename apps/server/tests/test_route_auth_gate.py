"""Structural auth gate: every mounted ``/api`` route must wire an
authentication dependency, or be listed in ``PUBLIC_ROUTES`` with a reason.

This is a *structural* check ("is a guard wired?"), not a *semantic* one
("does it actually reject?"). It exists to catch the "new router without auth"
class — a router added in ``app.main`` without a router-level scope guard and
without endpoint-level auth — at PR time instead of in production.

Why introspection works: FastAPI propagates ``include_router(dependencies=...)``
down into every route, so a router-level ``Depends(require_scope(...))`` shows
up in that route's ``dependant.dependencies`` tree just like an endpoint-level
``Depends(get_current_admin)`` does. We therefore walk the recursive dependency
tree and look for any known auth callable by its ``module:qualname``.

Adding a genuinely public route is a deliberate act: the test forces a line in
``PUBLIC_ROUTES`` (with a reason), rather than letting an unguarded route slip
in silently.
