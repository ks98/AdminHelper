"""Enrollment-token minting for human clients (ADR 0001 §3.3 / A5).

The desktop (and later the browser) authenticates with its JWT and mints a
one-time, access-scoped enrollment token, then redeems it at the ca-issuer to
get its mTLS client cert. This is the human counterpart to provision/activate
(which mints a tunnel-scoped token for agents). Deliberately JWT-gated, NOT
cert-gated: the client has no cert yet — this is its bootstrap door.
