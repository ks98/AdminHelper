# Simple Remote Manager

A lightweight Windows + Linux connection manager built with **Tauri v2 + Rust** and a fast **HTML/CSS/JS** UI. Manage SSH, RDP, and Web targets in one place with tags, search, and a clean workflow.

## Highlights

- **SSH / RDP / Web** connections in a single app
- **List + Tree view** (tree is generated from tags)
- **Tags + search** for fast filtering
- **Sync mode**: load connections from a remote **HTTPS JSON** on startup and on a schedule
- **Secure by design**: passwords are **not stored by default** (optional per-device storage)
- **Localization**: German + English, auto-detected on first start (changeable later)

## Platform behavior

- **SSH**
  - Windows: opens Windows Terminal (or cmd) and runs `ssh`
  - Linux: opens the first available terminal (gnome-terminal, konsole, xfce4-terminal, xterm, alacritty, kitty, wezterm, ...)
- **RDP**
  - Windows: opens `mstsc`
  - Linux: uses **FreeRDP** (`xfreerdp3` or `xfreerdp`)
- **Web**: opens the default browser

## Security notes

- **Passwords are not saved by default**. Optional per-device storage uses the OS keychain/credential store.
- Password storage is currently **RDP-only**. SSH uses keys and does not store passwords; Web connections do not have password fields.
- On Linux RDP, the password dialog is shown in-app and passed to FreeRDP via **stdin**.
- On Windows RDP, stored credentials are written to the Windows Credential Manager and used by `mstsc`.
- Local data files are written with **0600 permissions** on Unix systems.

## Data & settings

The app stores data in the OS-specific *app data directory*:

- `connections.json`
- `settings.json`

You can find the folder by searching for those filenames on your system.

### Sync format (HTTPS JSON)

The remote JSON must be a plain array of connection objects, e.g.:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "My Server",
    "kind": "ssh",
    "host": "example.com",
    "port": 22,
    "username": "user",
    "domain": "",
    "keyPath": "~/.ssh/id_ed25519",
    "url": "",
    "notes": "",
    "tags": ["prod"],
    "trustCert": false,
    "lastUsed": "2026-01-27T10:39:21.574Z"
  }
]
```

Notes:
- `kind` = `ssh` | `rdp` | `web`
- `trustCert` only affects RDP
- Sync requires **https://** URLs
- In **Sync mode**, editing/creating/deleting connections is disabled
- Passwords are **never** included in sync data

### Settings

- **Mode**: Local or Sync
- **Sync URL** and **interval** (Sync mode only)
- **Language**: German/English
- **Store passwords locally**: Optional, per-device, OS keychain (RDP only)

## Build & Run

### Requirements

- Rust (stable)
- Tauri CLI (`cargo tauri`)
- Supported OS: Windows, Linux
- Platform WebView dependencies (see Tauri docs for your OS)
- **Linux RDP**: `xfreerdp3` or `xfreerdp`

### Dev

```bash
cargo tauri dev
```

### Build

```bash
cargo tauri build
```

> For Windows, building on **Windows** is recommended for the installer/bundler.
